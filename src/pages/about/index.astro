        My name is Andreo and I currently work as a Open Source Consultant at

          class="underline underline-offset-6">Inuits</a

          calculateYearsSinceStarted(1675238400000)
        } years ago, and it's been a ride of constant growth and learning since.
        As a full stack developer with a strong focus on frontend technologies, I
        enjoy tackling challenges that push me to broaden my skillset. My latest
        work was for the Flemish Agency of Internal Affairs (ABB). At ABB, I contributed
        to building and improving multiple web apps that support local governments
        in their daily operations.

        Outside of tech, I'm really into sound design. When I'm not at work, I'm
        most likely in my studio finishing some tracks on Ableton. Otherwise,
        you can find me at the bar with friends or sharpening my DJ skills for
        my next gig.</Text
